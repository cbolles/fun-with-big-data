# Project Brief

The project will be to implement a REST API of your choosing and pull meaningful data from the REST API. Meaningful
meaning vaguely useful. Try ranking the data or sorting it into different groups like in the NFL example. Once we have
the data we will print it out so it is easier to look through

# Project Steps
## 1. Pick a REST API
Checkout [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) for a great list of REST APIs. I have some listed below you
can use separated into easy and hard. Easy ones are like the examples in class, no authentication needed. Hard require
authentication to use. Feel free to experiment and find one you find interesting

### Easy

Remember it does not have to be from this list, pick any REST API you are interested

## 2. Determine that data you will collect
At a high level pick what you want to pull from the REST API. They do not have to be complicated stats, just proof that
you can work with the data you pull. Below are some examples

* The average value of a cryto-coin [(Coin Lore)](https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api)
* Get a list of 5 activities to kill boredom that require X participants [(Fight Boredom)](https://www.boredapi.com/)
* Get a taco recipe that uses a given ingredient [(Tacos)](https://github.com/evz/tacofancy-api)
* Create a game where players answer trivia questions [(Trivia)](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
* Determine the player stats for a given user [(PUBG Stats)](https://developer.pubg.com/)

As long as you are pulling data from a REST API and changing it somehow you should be able to do it

## 3. Verify your project idea
Come up to Mr. Shanks or myself to make sure your project will count. Its fine if it changes, the goal is to make sure
you are doing something semi-meaningful

### 4. Get started
Create a new file `my_project.py` and use the previous examples to work on your project
